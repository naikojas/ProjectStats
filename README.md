# Project-Statistics
Built an easy and simple tool where you provide the name of the project you are looking for and it gives 
you the list of top 15 related repos sorted in the order of stars and their respective urls

## Steps to run the tool on your local machine:
```
$ git clone 
```
#### Move to the project directory

```
$ npm install 
```
*__Make sure to include your mongoDB connection url in the .env file__*

```
$ node index.js
```

Move over to http://localhost:8000/ to see the application running.
